# METOR
Repo for IJCAI2025 paper METOR: A Unified Framework for Mutual Enhancement of Objects and Relationships in Open-vocabulary Video Visual Relationship Detection

Due to limited bandwidth, we will first prioritize the open-sourcing of our TPAMI paper, "End-to-end Open-vocabulary Video Visual Relationship Detection using Multi-modal Prompting" (repository: [wangyongqi558/EOV-MMP-VidVRD](https://github.com/wangyongqi558/EOV-MMP-VidVRD)). The open-sourcing for the current work, which builds upon the former, will follow afterwards.
